General Description: Title: A Walk among Murals: Exploring the History and Legacy of Mexican Muralists | Description: Mexican muralism was an artistic and political movement that emerged in Mexico in the 1920s, in the midst of the Mexican Revolution. It was an artistic movement that focused on the creation of public murals that depicted the history, traditions and social struggles of Mexico. This movement generated great controversy at the time, but today it is recognized as one of the most important in the history of Mexican and world art.

On this 3-hour walking tour accompanied by your local guide and a small group of other travelers, you will have the opportunity to learn about the work of the three greats of Mexican muralism: Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. We will visit three different buildings in the Historic Center of Mexico City, where you will be able to appreciate the work of these and other artists, as well as learn more about their history and importance in the development of Mexican muralism.

In the morning, you will meet your guide at the designated meeting point to begin the experience. You will head to this historic site, whose name means “choppy water,” in reference to the system of lagoons and crystal-clear cenotes that characterize it. You will ride along the Sacbé, or white roads, which were built hundreds of years ago by the ancient Maya civilization as part of a commercial network connecting their various cities. Along the way, you will discover Nohoch Muul, the tallest pyramid in Cobá and the Riviera Maya. Rising 42 meters in the heart of the jungle, this structure reflects the cosmological beliefs of the Maya. It was considered a sacred place, with its central staircase symbolizing the entrance to the underworld. You will also learn about the famous Ball Game, or Poktapok, a ceremonial ritual in which players attempted to pass a rubber ball through stone hoops using only their hips. Additionally, you’ll discover Stela One, a massive carved stone that, according to the Maya calendar, marks December 21, 2012, as the end of an era. This is where the idea that the world would end on that date originated! At the end of the tour, you will return to the starting point, marking the conclusion of this extraordinary experience.

H. Lawrence wrote the first draft of his novel 'The Plumed Serpent'. You will also visit the old Nido Hotel, now housing the municipal presidency, and walk along its promenade until you reach the iconic 'love' pier, which you will stroll along to the lighthouse, a witness to the era when steamboats sailed the lake.

From Chapala, you will move to the charming Magic Town of Ajijic, whose name in Nahuatl means 'Place where the water springs'. This village will captivate you with its picturesque cobbled streets and adobe architecture. You will be able to see its main square and the murals that decorate the facades of houses, shops, and galleries, made by various painters who are part of the local artistic community. Of course, you will enjoy a pleasant walk along its boardwalk, where the view of the lake and the Sierra will leave you breathless, thus concluding this experience.

Accompanied by your guide and pedalling a bicycle, you will get to know the jungle and the cenotes.

The initiative allows visitors to explore virgin jungles, discover the fauna and become one with nature. The bike ride is short, it is important that you enjoy swimming in the cenotes. The first one is known locally as La Cuevita; an enclosed cenote where your guide will tell you anecdotes and stories about the place. Next, you will go to an open cenote where you will enjoy some relaxing moments surrounded by the abundant nature where, with a bit of luck, you will be able to observe some of the endemic birds of the Yucatan Peninsula. Finally, you will visit an open cenote of spectacular beauty. All of them are part of a system fed by the largest underground river in the world. At the end of the designated time for the activity, your experience will be over.
